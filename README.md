Place the TANAutoMailer.exe file anywhere on your computer.  Create a shortcut to it in the 'Startup' folder so it runs at boot for convenience.

Upon running, a blue folder icon will appear in your taskbar.  Right-click on it and select 'Manage Profiles'.

Fill out the form and click save to start monitoring a folder.  You can create as many profiles as you wish.  A new thread is created for each profile.

If you supply SMTP credentials they are securely stored in the Windows Credential Manager store.

Enjoy!
